OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development on EVM. Use via inheritance (e.g. ERC20, AccessControl) or `using for` (e.g. ECDSA, Math). Covers access control (Ownable, RBAC, AccessManager, TimelockController), tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, ERC4626, ERC6909), upgradeable variants, and utilities (crypto, math, introspection, structures, storage).
